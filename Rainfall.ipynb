    "# Rainfall \n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to replicate for the UK the map of [120 years of rainfall in Australia](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/history/rainfall/) published by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This is a very interesting map that shows precipitation by decile, colouring areas from red (very dry) to blue (very wet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciles help us grasp how much rainfall there has been in a certain year in a certain location in relation to the typical rainfall of that location. The idea is that you can show whether, for example, a given year's rainfall was in the top 10% (very wet, compared to all years in this location!) or in the bottom 10% (very dry, compared to all years in this location). \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation is relatively easy (and there are python formulas that we can exploit). To understand it say you had 40 years of annual rainfall records:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. you would first need to arrange the totals in ascending order (from lowest to highest). \n",
    "2. then, split all years into 10 equal groups lin this example you would get 10 groups of four).\n",
    "3. the first group, the one with the four lowest annual rainfalls on record, would be in decile range one. \n",
    "4. the second group, with the next lowest annual rainfalls, would be in decile range two\n",
    "5. etc etc... up to the four highest annual totals (highest 10 per cent) which would be in decile range 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for the UK comes from [CEDA](http://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/ukcp09/data/gridded-land-obs/gridded-land-obs-daily/timeseries/rainfall) but there is potentially data from the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data) that can be used for the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from CEDA is brilliant because it is gridded. In this case, I'm using the very accurate 5km grid, but there is data that is even more accurate (1km), or less. The map-generation process, however, is always the same."
